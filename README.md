# no-no mouse

Ouch, ouch.. please, save my wrists.

Moving my "ergonomic" mouse is a big no-no.

It still hurts.

What about no-no mouse?

My keyboard is comfortable.

Wait. What if I controlled mouse's cursor+clicks+rolling
with my keyboard?

Ah, solved.

That is the NO-NO MOUSE!

## Usage

Aaaaah, I'll fill this later, good luck hahah

### How to use really?

Somehow, like using your WM configuration, create a shortcut that will
execute no-no mouse.

Then you can activate no-no mouse mode with whatever key, whenever you want.

## Compatibility

It probably works on most Linux distros.

It **does not matter if you use X11 or Wayland**,
no-no mouse relies on `/dev/input` stuffs.

## Security

You have to use `sudo` to run no-no mouse.

Please, do a favor for yourself and read the code
before running it.

You want to save your wrists but you do not want to
risk hurting your computer.

## Contributing

Create an issue or a PR.

If you use AIs as code assistants, a good thing is to add both `./prompt.md`
and `./specs.md` to their context.
